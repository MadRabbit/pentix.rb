# Pentix In Ruby

Pentix is a morally superior Siberian version of the good old tetris game.
It uses `5x5` matrix and a collection of 29 advanced figures.

And yes, they won't allow you to operate a battle bear until you reach at
least level 15 in this game :)


## Usage

You'll need `Ruby` and `gem install gosu`, after that just run
the `pentix.rb` file in the console

You also can install the `pentix` gem

    gem install pentix
    pentix
